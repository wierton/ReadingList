## Conference
* ICSE、FSE、ASE
* OSDI、PLDI、POPL、ATC、SOSP、ISSTA

## Journal
* TSE、TOSEM、TOPLAS

## Labels
* SMT: satisfiability modulo theory
* Program Slicing:
* Metamorphic Testing: mutate testcases while maintaining some invariants
* Refactor: help refactor the code
* Test Acceration: help accelerate some existsing testing methodologies or unit testing/regression testing
* Web Application: as is
* Fault Localization: find where is possibly the bug
* Misc Testing: hard to classify
* Concolic Execution: combine symbolic execution and concrete execution
* Fuzzing: randomly generate/manipulate inputs with some heuristic
* Configuration: detect errors in configuration or test systems which higly depends on configuration
* Verification: manually or automatically give proof to program's properties
* Fault Injection: delibrately return rubbish/inconsistent result to program when invoke external api/syscall
* Testcase Reduction: reduce testcases' numbers or size
* Program Comprehension: extract high level summary from program
* Testing: as is
* Debugging: help better debugging or related to debugging tools
* Fault Tolarating: runtime mechanism to help program still keep running after fault
* Performance: improve program's performance, or find performance bugs
* Synthesis: construct program/code pieces/DSL and etc
* Generation: testcase generation, for testing
* Replay: replay trace which cause the bug
* JavaScript: as is
* Symbolic Execution: execute program with symbols and constraints
* Regression Testing: as is
* Fomalization: a lot of formulas/symbols, strictly illustrate the complicated (sometimes naive) solutions/problems/concepts
* Testcase Prioritization: reorder testcases to help faster testing
* Mutation: Mutate existing testcases
* Program Analysis: dynamic or static analysis of program
* Repair: fix program either from compile-time or from runtime
* Invariant Deduction: kind of program analysis
* Model Checking: STFW
